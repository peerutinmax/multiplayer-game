This is my Software Testing coursework, in which I use ChrisCourse's Multiplayer Game as the piece of software that I choose to test. 

ChrisCourse's youtube tutorial can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXquxWtE5vA&list=PLpPnRKq7eNW16Wq1GQjQjpTo_E0taH0La&index=12

ChrisCourse's GitHub repo for the source code can be found here: https://github.com/chriscourses/multiplayer-game
